title:  "Lesson 10: Deconvolution"
order: 10
learning: "By the end of this lesson, we should better understand how multi-cellular pixel-resolution spatial transcriptomics data can be deconvolved and how the resulting deconvolved results can be visualized. Our in-class hands-on component will involve performing deconvolution using STdeconvolve and interpreting results."
