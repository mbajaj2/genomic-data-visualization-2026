title:  "Lesson 9: Spatially variable genes"
order: 9
learning: "By the end of this lesson, we should be able to understand how to identify spatially variable genes in our data using Morans I. We will also be able to use interactive data visualizations to get some sense for the quality of our analysis. Our in-class hands-on component will involve calculating Morans I."
